# Full-Analysis-of-Bigbasket-Products
The "Full Analysis of BigBasket Products - Data Analysis Project" involved a comprehensive exploration of sales data from BigBasket, a leading online grocery retailer. Through this project, I addressed key business questions and leveraged data analysis techniques to derive valuable insights, contributing to informed decision-making.
Key Achievements and Responsibilities:
1. Top and Bottom Performers: Identified the top 10 and least 10 sold products, allowing for a focus on high-performing and underperforming items.
2. Category Analysis: Determined which product category had the highest sales in terms of both quantity and profit, aiding in resource allocation and strategic planning.
3. Highly Rated Products: Identified products with a rating of 4 or higher and their corresponding categories, highlighting customer-preferred items.
4. Discounted vs. Original Price Products: Analyzed the distribution and profit percentages of discounted and original price products, enabling insights into pricing strategies.
5. Correlation Analysis: Explored the potential relationship between product ratings and sale prices, helping to understand consumer behavior.
